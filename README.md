# DataAnalysisClinic
The purpose of the clinic is so that we can help you with common data analysis tasks in R and Python. In addition, we also want to create a useful resource for the institute. Therefore the clinic will be open to all, regardless of whether  you have specific data that you want help with. The code generated in the workshop will be made available afterwards.

If you have a specific problem or task that you wish to be tackled in the clinic, please send me the details and advise me where I can obtain the data. Be prepared for the data and analysis scripts to be made "public" (within the C.I. at least). We can annoymise the data if need be or create a more manageable subset of the data. The task should be fairly self-contained and not require too much background-knowledge of the particular experiment. The kind of problems and tasks we have in mind are:-

- Reading data into R
- Retrieving data from public repositories
- Filtering, subsetting, and manipulation of data in R or Python
- Combining multiple datasets
- How to create common plots (scatter plot, boxplot, histogram, heatmap, venn diagram, etc.)
- "Why doesn't my code work?!?!"

Other sensible suggestions are welcome. If it is not feasible to tackle your problem during the clinic, we will endeavour to direct you to a more appropriate avenue.
